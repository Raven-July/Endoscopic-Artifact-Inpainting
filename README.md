# Endoscopic-Artifact-Inpainting-for-Improved-Endoscopic-Image-Segmentation
Inspired by the simplified Phong model for endoscopy, we propose a two-stage artifact inpainting framework. The first stage suppresses specular artifacts, while the second stage focuses on inpainting diffuse artifacts. Additionally, we introduce a weight map to control the handling of diffuse artifacts, ensuring a more precise enhancement.

The full train and inference code are coming soon...
